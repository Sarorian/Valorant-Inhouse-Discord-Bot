# Personal Valorant Inhouse Bot

This is a discord bot I made as a personal project so my friends and I could play games together

**Cool Features**

- A registration feature so users can link their Discord profile to a PUUID (Player Universal Unique ID)
- Integration with a 3rd Party API (shoutout HenrikDev) to access players ranks and PUUIDs
- An auto-balancing feature which computes the most balanced teams based off of players current ranks
- Custom rank tracking for players completly seperate from the Valorant ranks. Players will gain more ranking (SR) for winning harder games

**Coming Soon**

- Opt-in queue system to make balancing automatic after getting 10 players

## Running the Bot

Currently the bot is hosted on a 3rd party website and is turned on when needed (to save money)

### Running the Bot Yourself

1. First clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Update your .env file with your Discord Bot Token
4. Run the bot in test mode `npm test`
